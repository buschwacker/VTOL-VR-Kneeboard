The PNGs folder contains images for all REDFOR RWR symbols as well as all REDFOR units in <a href=https://vtolvr.bdynamicsstudio.com/>VTOL VR</a> (as of the writing of this README). Organized by folder: 
- RWR REDFOR Threat = RWR symbols organized by the threat posed by each unit.
- RWR REDFOR ABC = RWR symbols organized alphabetically
- Index Air = REDFOR Air units
- Index Land = REDFOR Land units
- Index Sea = REDFOR naval units
- QR Brevity = Brevity code quick reference, organized by definition
- Index Brevity ABC = Brevity code index organized alphabetically 
- Index Acronym ABC = Acronym/Jargon index organized alphabetically

I use <a href=https://openkneeboard.com/>OpenKneeboard</a> by simply saving the entire PNGs folder and pointing OpenKneeboard to the subfolders so that each subfolder is a separate tab.
I also use a wireless numpad tied to my knee to cycle between tabs and pages :)

May your IFF always be true.
